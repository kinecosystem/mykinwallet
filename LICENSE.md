    Accordingly, you acknowledge and agree that:

    1.  You are responsible for all taxes imposed on you, including
        determining whether taxes apply to your receipt of Kin, and for
        collecting, reporting, withholding, or remitting any taxes arising
        from the receipt and use of the awards provided pursuant to the Kin
        Rewards Engine in the jurisdiction where you reside or that is

        apply to your Kin transactions, or for collecting, reporting,
        withholding, or remitting any taxes arising from any Kin
        transactions. In the event withholding taxes are required under
        applicable law, Kin Foundation will be entitled to withhold and
        deduct the amounts required to be withheld from any amounts payable
        hereunder. If required by applicable law, the value of Kin provided
        to you, including through KRE, may be reported for tax purposes. If
        required by, you will be required to fill in additional forms in
        order to receive your award.

        any United States state securities laws or the laws of any foreign
        jurisdiction. Kin Foundation makes no representations that any
        exchange will exist for the sale or conversion of Kin into any other
        cryptocurrency or fiat currency.

    7.  Kin is subject to a high degree of risk, volatility and illiquidity.
        You should make your own investigations and evaluations of Kin that
        will be delivered pursuant thereto. You should inform yourself as to

    2.  The following Sections, together with any other provision of this
        SDK License which expressly or by its nature survives termination or
        expiration, or which contemplates performance or observance

        14 (Terms and Termination; Survival), 15 (General Provisions) and
        Appendix A (Software Contribution Terms).

15. **General Provisions**

    1.  __Choice of Law.__ Except as restricted by applicable law,
        this SDK License will be governed by the laws of the Province of
        Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein and such
        laws apply to your access to or use of the Software, notwithstanding
        your domicile, residency or physical location. You will only use the
        Software in jurisdictions where the Software may lawfully be used.
        Except as restricted by applicable law, you hereby consent to the
        exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in Toronto, Ontario,
        Canada in all disputes arising out of or relating to the use of the
        Software.

    2.  __Arbitration.__ Except as restricted by applicable law:

        1.  Except as described in Section 15b.i., 15b.ii. and 15b.iii.,
            any dispute or claim between you and us relating to or arising out
            of this SDK License will be referred to and determined exclusively
            through binding confidential arbitration conducted in Toronto,
            Ontario, Canada, unless you are a resident of the United States, in
            which case the arbitration will be held in a location within 100
            miles of your residence, unless the parties agree otherwise. The
            arbitration will be held on an individual basis, before a single
            arbitrator and in accordance with the applicable Ontario arbitration
            statute (the Arbitration Act, 1991, S.O. 1991, c.17, as amended, or
            the International Commercial Arbitration Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.9,
            as amended, or such other statute that may be enacted). The
            arbitration will not be open to the public or media and all evidence
            discovered or submitted is confidential and may not be publicly
            disclosed, except as needed to enforce an arbitral award.

        2.  Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is
            less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US \$10,000.00) may be resolved
            through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of
            the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total
            amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US
            \$10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by
            the arbitration rules.

        3.  You and Kin Foundation may also take claims to small claims court in
            Toronto, Ontario, Canada if the dispute qualifies for hearing by
            that court.

        4.  BY YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE, YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO
            COURT TO ASSERT ANY CLAIMS, EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO
            SMALL CLAIMS COURT.

        5.  You and Kin Foundation also agree that: (i) you and the Kin
            Foundation will each pay such portion of the costs of the
            arbitration (which consists of each party's legal expenses, the fees
            and expenses of the arbitrator, and any other expenses related to
            the arbitration) as determined by the arbitrator; (ii) the
            arbitrator may, in making an award of costs, consider whether costs
            are prohibitive compared to litigating in a court, and may require
            Kin Foundation to pay a greater portion of the fees and expenses of
            the arbitrator, or the travel expenses of you or any witness, in
            which case Kin Foundation will pay as much of your arbitration costs
            as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent such
            cost-prohibitiveness; (iii) the arbitrator will honor claims of
            privilege and privacy recognized at law; (iv) the arbitrator may
            award any individual relief or individual remedies that are
            permitted by applicable law; and (v) the arbitrator's award will be
            final and non-appealable, but may be enforced in any court of
            competent jurisdiction.

        6.  THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS
            TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY,
            INSTEAD ELECTING THAT ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WILL BE RESOLVED BY
            ARBITRATION UNDER THIS SDK LICENSE. ARBITRATION PROCEDURES ARE
            TYPICALLY MORE LIMITED, MORE EFFICIENT AND LESS COSTLY THAN RULES
            APPLICABLE IN COURT AND ARE SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A
            COURT. IN THE EVENT ANY LITIGATION SHOULD ARISE BETWEEN YOU AND KIN
            FOUNDATION IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT IN A SUIT TO VACATE OR
            ENFORCE AN ARBITRATION AWARD OR OTHERWISE, YOU AND KIN FOUNDATION
            WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, INSTEAD ELECTING THAT THE DISPUTE
            BE RESOLVED BY A JUDGE.

        7.  __CLASS ACTION WAIVER.__ THE ARBITRATION WILL BE CONDUCTED
            ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR
            REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN
            ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A
            REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE
            RELIEF.

        8.  __Right to Opt Out.__ You have the right to opt out of
            this agreement to arbitrate by sending written notice of your
            decision to opt out, postmarked, to c/o 137 Glasgow Street, Suite
            525, Kitchener, Ontario, N2G 4X8. Your written notice must include
            your name, address and email address. If you send written notice,
            then the mandatory arbitration provisions in this SDK License will
            not apply to you or Kin Foundation. IF YOU DO NOT SEND THIS WRITTEN
            NOTICE, THEN YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE MANDATORY ARBITRATION
            PROVISIONS IN THIS SDK LICENSE.

    3.  __Entire Agreement.__ This SDK License constitute the
        entire agreement between you and us pertaining to the subject matter
        hereof and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and
        proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between you and us
        with respect to the Software. A printed version of this SDK License
        and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in
        judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to
        this SDK License to the same extent and subject to the same
        conditions as other business documents and records originally
        generated and maintained in printed form.

    4.  __Waiver.__ Our failure to insist upon or enforce strict
        performance of any provision of this SDK License will not be
        construed as a waiver of any provision or right. A waiver of any
        provision of this SDK License must be in writing and a waiver in one
        instance will not preclude enforcement of such provision on other
        occasions.

    5.  __Severable.__ If any of the provisions contained in this
        SDK License are determined to be void, invalid or otherwise
        unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision
        will be severed from this SDK License and all other provisions of
        this SDK License will remain in full force and effect.

    6.  __Assignment.__ You will not assign this SDK License to
        any third party without our prior written consent. We may assign
        this SDK License or any rights under this SDK License to any third
        party without your consent. Any assignment in violation of this
        Section will be void. The terms of this SDK License will be binding
        upon permitted assignees. This SDK License will inure to the benefit
        of and be binding upon the parties, their permitted successors and
        permitted assignees.

    7.  __Force Majeure.__ We will not be liable for delays caused
        by any event or circumstances beyond Kin Foundation's reasonable
        control, including acts of God, acts of government, flood, fire,
        earthquakes, civil unrest, acts of terror, strikes or other labour
        problems, Internet service failures or delays.

    8.  __English Language.__ It is the express wish of the
        parties that this SDK License and all related documents be drawn up
        in English. C'est la volonté expresse des parties que la présente
        convention ainsi que les documents qui s'y rattachent soient rédigés
        en anglais.
